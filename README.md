A fully custom C++ raytracer based on fundamentals in https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html

It has the ability to render spheres, triangles, light sources, emissive textures, roughness, transparency, reflections, caustics, metallic surfaces, moving cameras, hard and soft shadows, and more. All physically based traced reflections and refractions.
Ability to use multiple threads. I'm planning to add .obj support and clean up everything but haven't yet. WIP.
